# Numerical methods for solving linear and non-linear equations in MATLAB
 This repo is a collection of MATLAB scripts I wrote to help me cross check practice problem answers in my Numerical Methods course.  
 
 The following numerical methods are included:
- Bairstow's method
- Naive Gauss elimination
- LU decomposition
- The matrix inverse
- Gauss-Seidel
- Regression methods
- Newton's divided-difference interpolating polynomials
- Lagrange interpolating polynomials
- The trapezoidal rule
- Simpson's rules
- Romberg integration
- Gauss quadrature
- Euler's method
- Runge-Kutta methods
- Finite divided-distance differentiation
- Richardson extrapolation
